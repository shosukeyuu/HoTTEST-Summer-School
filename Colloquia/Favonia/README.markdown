The video recording is available at <https://youtu.be/VbBDxVEu_bA>. The slides contain no known mistakes, but the recording has some:

1. At 00:25:38, I meant to mention the mathematician “Daniel Kan,” but said something like “Don??? Kan” instead.

2. Around 00:27:18, I said the type theory would have been broken. A better answer is that the types would likely be forced to have compositions due to the global coherence of a type theory, but if so, it is not obvious how terms compute in the presence of those forced compositions. That said, I feel this explanation is not entirely satisfactory, either.

3. At 01:03:25, I wrote “trasp”, which should have been “transp”. “n” was missing.

4. I mentioned the paper “Unifying Cubical Models of Univalent Type Theory”. I could not find when I talked about it. However, I believe I did not get the author list correct. The paper is available at <https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/11657> and its authors are Evan Cavallo, Anders Mörtberg, and Andrew W Swan.
